Despite a significant drop in Tesla stock following the Q3 earnings call, experts remain optimistic about the company's long-term outlook. Tesla's focus on cutting-edge technology in areas like AI and self-driving capabilities is expected to position the company for future growth. The robo-taxi thesis is a critical aspect of Tesla's future plans, with a high likelihood of success in the near future. While the Q3 call generated a mixed reaction from investors, many believe that Tesla's future remains bright and that it is a potentially attractive investment opportunity.

=====

Tesla's Q3 earnings call caused uncertainty, resulting in a stock plummet of over 10%, the greatest in history. Tesla's stock is known for being very unstable with past declines as well. The misunderstanding of the CFO's statements added to the confusion. Tesla has announced that their focus will be full self-driving AI.

=====

Tesla's Q3 earnings call led to significant losses for Tesla shares, marking the company's biggest single-day fall in history. Although some investors anticipated this due to production cuts in upgrades, others are capitalizing on the reduced share price by purchasing more.

=====

Tesla stock suffered a 10% loss following Q3 earnings call. The biggest single day loss in the company's history. Tesla remains highly volatile and the CFO misspoke on financial metrics.

=====

Tesla plans to pivot from being an automaker to being a supplier of power electronics, batteries, and charging infrastructure. The company's ultimate goal is to license full self-driving capabilities. While FSD is not yet part of the company's valuation model, many view it as the real money maker. Despite Tesla's pivot to focus on autonomy, short-term traders and gamblers remain focused on gross automotive margins and volumes.

=====

The author notes that critics of Tesla and Elon Musk are often those that manage other people's finances, emotionally-volatile, or uninformed. Conversely, stable investors view Tesla as a buying opportunity. Efficient charging stations are necessary due to the demand for electric vehicles. The author is surprised when a journalist asks about Tesla's 10-year outlook, instead of focusing on short-term issues. The author compares Tesla's progression to Netflix's evolution.

=====

Tesla is focusing on becoming a supplier to OEMs as it provides a better pathway for profitability. BMW and Toyota have only recently joined the Tesla Supercharger Network having taken some time to come on board.

=====

Tesla has made significant progress with its transition into being an automobile supplier adding BMW to the Tesla Supercharger Network in North America. Toyota has also adopted the North American charging standard to access Tesla Superchargers in North America, and battery electric vehicles starting 2025 will feature Tesla charging ports. This progress highlights the convenience and profitability of becoming a supplier for an automaker.

=====

Toyota joins the North American charging standard to increase customer charging options, finally adapting to the Tesla Supercharger Network. The expanding network of adopters including BMW, Lexus, and Volvo is essentially becoming a Tesla-dominated arena for electronic components and, eventually, FSD. Tesla's steady transition toward OEM supply is putting holdouts like VW and Audi at a disadvantage.

=====

Several major auto manufacturers, such as Honda, Acura, and K rivan, count Tesla among their partners for important technologies related to batteries, power electronics, charging, and self-driving cars. Some major players, including Tatis and Volkswagen, have not yet taken advantage of Tesla's unparalleled technology and could miss out on significant benefits in this rapidly changing landscape. Tesla's focus will likely increasingly be on software and production supply chain development, thus limiting the importance of traditional automotive manufacturing to the company's overall value. Pie charts like Tom's, which contain information that is yet to exist, should be called into question because they violate Wall Street's regulatory restrictions.

=====

Tesla needs cars for its proof of concept but is aiming for a completely different future. Robo taxis make up 70% of Tesla's 305 price target, with 20% allocated to FSD, while cars make up only 10%. Tesla intends to prove how profitable FSD could be and hopes to showcase the promising Robo taxi in the future. Separating the car business out might happen in the future once its profitability potential becomes apparent.

=====

According to sources, Tesla's robo taxi thesis is the company's next big thing, scheduled to happen soon. Late 2024 is the anticipated period for the first Tesla robo taxis to roll out. Despite being one of Elon's projects, its profitability may be quite large, with many investors getting excited about the prospect. While the humanoid robot is a great accomplishment, the robo taxi may be a far more profitable venture for Tesla.

=====

My confidence in the estimate that Tesla's first robot taxi affair will take place in late 2024 has massively increased due to the recent FSD demo.

=====

Elon Musk's "robo taxi thesis" will become a reality soon, according to a Tesla valuation model predicting that Tesla robo taxis would start operating by the end of 2024. Confidence in this estimate has increased following the recent N-to-N FSD demo. However, people may still be underestimating the project, and Elon Musk's recent earnings call with Wall Street analysts failed to provide some of the specific details they were looking for.

=====

While Elon's robo taxi project could be profitable, it is not currently included in Tesla's valuation. The timing of the first Tesla robot taxi launch has not changed, with most analysts predicting it to happen in late 2024.

=====

Wall Street wanted deception, lies, and a false smile from Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk. Instead, he delivered an honest and transparent discussion of the company's challenges including economic difficulties and high interest rates that put pressure on their stock. While long-term prospects for the company remain positive, the lack of transparency was a point of concern for investors.

=====

Elon Musk's Tesla will continue ramping production and keep prices stable for the time being, but there is no fixed price limit on the horizon. Prices will be adjusted as needed to achieve market clearing goals. Without a crystal ball, there is no line in the sand, and communication skills are essential. The company must advertise but avoid delivering vehicles with ridiculous waiting times. Tesla may have to adjust prices in response to market instability in the future.

=====

Tesla is willing to adjust prices on their vehicles to sell them and ensure weight times aren't ridiculous.

=====

Tesla's long-term goals remain strong despite the company's disappointing earnings call. The reaction of Wall Street will not alter the company's outlook.
