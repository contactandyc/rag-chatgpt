Tesla stock collapses after Q3 earnings. We think investors are kind of missing the forest for the trees here. Then what does Tesla look like, take me 10 years down the road for this company? Are we talking about a completely different beast? If you look at my 305 price target, only 10% is cars, actually 70% of it is robo taxi, and 20% of it is just FSD itself. So, this is a completely different future for this company. Don't underestimate the robo taxi thesis, that is a very real thing, it's 100% happening. I think it's going to happen before you know it too. I mean, if you looked up disaster in the dictionary, there'd be a video of last night's conference call. We believe the long-term story is intact, the sum of the parts thesis - full self-driving AI, what they're going to invest in, but no doubt in the near term and because of that conference call, you know I think you're definitely going to see uncertainty. Today, a very mixed bag of reactions after Tesla's Q3 earnings call, and Tesla stock itself collapses. As usual, Tesla stock is down 9.3% during hours and down another 1% after hours for a total of more than 10%, which is par for the course with Tesla stock. In case you have a short memory or lack of perspective, I found this on X. We're looking at the biggest one day loss on Tesla stock from open to close throughout the company's history, biggest daily loss down 21.1% that was in 2020, followed by 19.3%. We've had a down day of 18.6%, 17.2%, 16%. You guys get the point right? Let's keep scrolling. Where can we find today's loss here? Still scrolling, we're in the 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%. Here we go. Today's loss during hours, number 31 on the list of biggest daily losses on Tesla stock. There have been 30 days in which Tesla stock was down more, many of those substantially more. As I've said in the past, Tesla stock remains more volatile than your ex-girlfriend, and for the record, I bought more today. Not that I was waiting to buy today, I just had more money today.

Full self-driving AI is what Tesla is going to invest in. There is no doubt that in the near term, there will be uncertainty due to the conference call.  A very mixed bag of reactions took place after Tesla's Q3 earnings call and this caused Tesla's stock to collapse, as usual. Tesla's stock was down 9.3% during hours and another 1% after hours for a total of more than 10%. This is part of the course with Tesla's stock, in case you have a short memory or lack of perspective. Historically, this is the biggest one day loss on Tesla's stock from open to close throughout the company's history, the biggest daily loss was down 21.1% in 2020, followed by 19.3%, 18.6%, 17.2%, and 16%. As you can see, there have been many down days. Tesla's stock remains more volatile than your ex-girlfriend. For the record, I bought more today, not that I was waiting for today. I just happened to have more money today, so it was convenient to do so. Thank you to everyone who noticed me having an auditory hallucination yesterday. I did misunderstand what the CFO said on Tesla's earnings call regarding volume cost, etc. I was confused because I misheard something that wasn't actually said. The most awkward part was that I wasn't even high. To be clear, what the Tesla CFO said yesterday was that one of Tesla's factories, either Berlin or Austin, had reached per unit cost of Fremont, not volume and cost, which makes a lot more sense. Hence why I was so confused. It was a mess on numbers and a miss on sentiment. I would say it was a trifecta of doom from Tesla. I am interested in hearing the other side of the trade.

In case you have a short memory or lack of perspective, I found this on X. We're looking at the biggest one-day loss on Tesla stock from open to close throughout the company's history. The biggest daily loss down 21.1% that was in 2020, followed by 19.3%. We've had a down day of 18.6%, 17.2%, 16%. You guys get the point, right? Let's keep scrolling. Where can we find today's loss?

By the way, thank you to everybody who noticed me having an auditory hallucination yesterday. I did mishear what CFO said on Tesla's earnings call regarding volume, cost, and so on. I was like, what the going on? Well, it turns out, the reason I was so confused is because I heard something that wasn't actually said. The most awkward part is, I wasn't even high. So, to be clear, what the Tesla CFO said yesterday was that one of Tesla's factories, either Berlin or Austin, had reached per unit cost of Fremont, not volume and cost, which makes a hell of a lot more sense. Hence, why I was so confused. It was a mess on numbers and a miss on sentiment. I would say it was a trifecta of Doom from Tesla. Tell me the other side of the trade. Yeah, certainly. I think people were expecting them to miss. They had some production cuts for upgrades.

But I think what the investor base is really missing is this is actually a part of a giant pivot towards becoming a supplier to other OEMs and eventually licensing FSD. Initially, they said they were going to have all these volumes, selling 20 million cars, and these sorts of things. I think we're noticing the company changing the narrative towards maybe not making as many cars, but now pivoting towards selling charging infrastructure, power electronics, batteries, and then, yes, FSD and autonomy. That's the real money maker. Anyway, we think investors are kind of missing the forest for the trees here. I have a lot to say on this. First of all, as most of you will know, when I first published my Tesla valuation model in 2021, I already included Tesla licensing FSD to other automotive manufacturers in the future. So this is a no-brainer. It's now since been confirmed that Tesla will do this. They've even disclosed that they've been in talks with a major automotive manufacturer about this very thing- licensing FSD- and one of the noted exceptions, as in it might happen, probably will happen, but it's not yet included in my valuation model. Also, from day one, it was Tesla licensing batteries to other automotive manufacturers, but only after they can meet their own needs, which is going to be a while. Regarding Tesla pivoting away from 20 million electric vehicles sold per year, unlikely. Very strongly disagree with Tom on this. That being said, he is right. Investors absolutely are missing the forest for the trees, at least short-term traded mindset investors who aren't really investors. They're short-term traders and gamblers. While everyone is laser-focused on short-term gross automotive margins and volumes and this, that, and the other, Tesla is on the cusp of solving autonomy and unlocking a trillion-dollar opportunity, but you wouldn't know that based on Tesla stocks' reaction today. All the armchair Einsteins telling Elon Musk that he's not very good at running an earnings call.

=====

And therefore, he shouldn't do it. I noticed, by the way, 99% of the people providing their unsolicited feedback on why Tesla sucks, and why Elon sucks, and everything else, 99% of these folks either manage money for other people, are curious, and or just extremely emotionally volatile in the first place, and possibly suffer from bipolar disorder. Not making a light, serious comment, why is that all the long-term investors who seem to be emotionally stable are like, 'bro, buying opportunity'? Isn't that interesting? That's really interesting, Tom, because you know, even here in the UK, if I do a road trip with an electric car, the supercharging stations are so much more efficient, and then you have the other ones where you have these long, long lines. So it's clear that there is demand for that kind of thing. But then, what does Tesla look like? Take me 10 years down the road for this company. Are we talking about a completely different beast? What the did she just say? Am I hallucinating again? Did someone in the fin media just ask somebody discussing Tesla to describe what the company looks like an entire decade from now? What's going on? I swear, after my recent hallucination, maybe I just imagined that as well. This is amazing to see but so strange. 10 years into the future, we're supposed to be worried about tomorrow or next quarter and panicking, especially about gross Automotive margins. I think so, absolutely. You know, it's interesting, you posited the Netflix example before, how it's creating today. If you remember, Netflix in 2002 to 2013 went through a very difficult transitioning shifting from DVD rentals towards streaming, and it was painful.

But then, what does Tesla look like? Take me 10 years down the road for this company. Are we talking about a completely different beast? What, did she just - am I hallucinating again?

If you remember, Netflix in 2002 to 2013 went through a very difficult transitioning, shifting from DVD rentals towards streaming, and it was painful, but then it wound up being wildly successful. I think something similar is afoot here with Tesla - from selling cars to now becoming a supplier to OEMs, which honestly is far more profitable. We just saw BMW announce yesterday they're joining Tesla Supercharger Network in North America. They said previously they'd never do this - met like never - and in fact, I roasted BMW for being extremely late to the party and then pointed out that there are still some hold outs. Well, guess what? Some breaking news: finally, the biggest Titanic of all! Toyota adopts the North American charging standard to expand customer charging options. Welcome Toyota, you morons! Toyota and Lexus customers will have access to more than 12,000 Tesla superchargers in North America, and Tesla and Lexus will incorporate the NACS ports - as in Tesla charging ports - in both Tesla and Lexus battery electric vehicles starting in 2025. It's embarrassing how long it's taken.

Some of the holdouts, you do have to ask yourself, what the hell are VW doing? What is Audi doing? I mean, hello! Why, a head scratcher? Tesla's really starting to become the place where OEMs have to go to for all of these things - batteries, power electronics, charging - and then we think ultimately FSD. What would that do to valuation? I'm looking back here on a 5-year chart - $412 is where it is. Why not say to the market...

Sub brands includes Volvo, Lotus, Porsche, Mercedes, Jaguar, Land Rover, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Honda, Acura, Hyundai, K rivan, BMW, Rolls-Royce, Mini, Toyota, Lexus, Suzuki, and Subaru. Some of the holdouts include Volkswagen and Tatis. I mean, hello, why? A head-scratcher. Tesla's really starting to become the place where OEMs have to go for all of these things: batteries, power electronics, charging. And then we think, ultimately, Full Self-Driving (FSD). What would that do to valuation? I'm looking back here on a 5-year chart. $412 is where it is. Why not say to the market, 'Actually, I'm going to carve out this Auto Production Unit and I'm going to have a Tech Manu.' I am a tech manufacturing supply chain company. With that hived off, what is a car company and gives you a tech company? Does that re-engineer the value quicker to $35? Would his ego let him do that? That's the question that goes in the back of my mind. Well, you kind of need the cars as a proof of concept right to see FSD to see the technology firsthand. So it's really a proof of concept today, but if you look at my $305 price target, you know only 10% of that is cars actually, um, I have 70% of it is Robo taxi and 20% of it is just FSD itself. So this is a completely different future for this company. And for what it's worth, my test of fair valuation, especially in the latter half of this decade, the slice that Automotive makes up of that entire valuation is a spec relative to everything else, in particular, FSD, the software component. Now, that being said, does anyone know the number to report a Wall Street analyst for breaking the rules? Because clearly, Tom is putting things in his spreadsheet that he's not allowed to. See, they don't yet exist, and that's illegal on Wall Street. So who do I call to get him fired or reprimanded? Anyone know? You need the car as the proof of concept. As far as separating these businesses out, maybe that happens in the future.

And then in the future, the robo taxi promise. That's ultimately what he talked a lot about in the call last night. And I think that's really ultimately going to solve this whole jigsaw puzzle. But can I ask you the one thing that I was fascinated about? Is the robot I'm going to need one of these in later life? I mean, I think this is a thing, it's going to be able to do yoga apparently next year the robot. What portion of Robotics, on a slightly more serious valuation note, will Robotics play in this company? I'm definitely hallucinating, right? They didn't just ask seriously about Tesla's humanoid robot and how that would contribute to Tesla's future valuation. I need to replace my Waterfield with it. I'm obviously tripping ball; somebody's put something in the water supply here. That didn't just actually happen, did it? I mean, today.

I'm obviously tripping balls, somebody's put something in the water supply here. That didn't just actually happen, did it? I mean, today... I'm not giving any credit for it right now. I think that's a call option to the future. That's an Elon project currently but Elon projects in the past have wound up being wildly profitable. So today, I don't include it in my valuation but don't underestimate the robo taxi thesis, that is a very real thing, it's 100% happening. I think it's going to happen before you know it too. Once again, I find myself in agreement with Tom. Most of you will know by now when I first published my Tesla valuation model back in 2021, I had the first Tesla robo tax affair taking place somewhere on Earth in 2024, as in late 2024. Again, if you got the original copy, you can go fact-check me, see exactly how many Robo-Taxis will be operating by the end of the year, not many. And while that estimate in terms of the timing has not changed, my confidence in that estimate has massively increased, especially after the recent n-to-n FSD demo. Now, I personally think that late 2024 is sooner than most people think. Of course, I could be wrong. I probably will be wrong. Just how wrong will I be? The bigger question is, when do most people, most analysts, expect Tesla robo-taxis will awaken? Because when they do, look out. I mean if you looked up disaster in the dictionary, there'd be a video of last night's conference call.

So, Dan suggesting that Tesla's earnings call was a quote disaster. Why? Because bigger, bad Elon Musk didn't give Wall Street what Wall Street wanted, just like how Tesla didn't give consumers what consumers wanted, which were internal combustion engine vehicles. Of course, I do understand his point. The Wall Street pointers wanted some numbers to put in their spreadsheets. Daddy to hold them and say everything's going to be all right.

The Wall Street point-deers wanted some numbers to put in their spreadsheets. Daddy to hold them and say, 'everything's going to be alright'.

But instead, Elon Musk is talking about the challenges of Tesla, including the extremely difficult economic situation, insane interest rates, concerns about rates being still high in the future or even higher, probably unlikely but you never know. In short, Elon Musk was honest, transparent, clear and Wall Street wanted deception, lies, and a false smile. May I suggest, Wall Street, you might find those things on a GM earnings call. Tesla tells it like it is, lacked details, and ultimately it was a somber note, especially when you look at Cybertruck and you look at the margin outlook, and I think the long-term thesis is still there. But with no rose-colored glasses, I mean, this was definitely what I'd call a disaster. Would you expect anything different from a guy who runs a company whose goods are 90% financed? Right, I mean that's that's the automobile. Now look there's no doubt that that's something that's helped them and now hurts him. But by far, I think the big issue was really around the price cuts because as you've seen the price cuts, there was a view that it would start to end by this point and ultimately by having the door open and also by losing your CFO, that was I think a huge part of the credibility investors came off that call with. And I can tell you institutionally speaking, just a lot more questions, no answers, and I think that's really the frustration and that's why you're seeing the stock under almost extra pressure because of that head-scratcher conference call last night. Dan, you're one of the biggest bulls on the street, you come here all the time and have talked up Tesla for years, correctly so in many ways. By the way, I'm glad you're here on a bad day too, but what did you get wrong here? I think what we got wrong in the short term was the price cuts were going to end. Should we tell them about the master plan? Oh wait, hang on, no it's a secret master plan. I forgot.

=====

I think what we got wrong in the short term was the price cuts were going to end. Should we, uh, should we tell them about the master plan? Oh, wait, hang on... no. It's a secret master plan. I forgot. Yeah, let's not mention that. No more price cuts will ever happen. Tesla's plan is to maintain exactly the same price points on their vehicles and just advertise a lot to sell them at today's prices forever. In their words, you knew the poker move of the price cuts. This year has paid off massively and I think that's really shown from a demand perspective. But, that did really... 95% of price cuts. I believe are done. I thought Musk would have put the line in the sand, maybe a few more price cuts, then we're over instead by leaving the door open. I think the communication is maybe what we underestimate, even for Musk, by not putting a line in the sand. That's the frustration here because now it's a Pandora's Box and you can't put the genie back in the bottle. But, well, how can he put a line in the sand on price cuts when we see the 10-year yield and the 30-year yield move up every single day to new highs? And if that's really what's driving it, how can you know? That's a really good question. You can't know. To explain this rather simply, Tesla is going to keep ramping production and they're going to keep adjusting prices on their vehicles to continue to sell all of them and while doing so, ensure that wait times aren't ridiculous. It's that simple: whatever is necessary. Whatever the market clearing price that is what Tesla will sell their vehicles for. So, I think what Dan is suggesting is, how dare Elon Musk not have a crystal ball and know what the future looks like so he could tell everybody exactly what Tesla will do before they do it? Yeah, and it's a great question. I think it's really about the price cuts and shine.

And they're going to keep adjusting prices on their vehicles to continue to sell all of them. And while doing so, they ensure that weight times aren't ridiculous. It's that simple. Whatever is necessary, whatever the market-clearing price, that is what Tesla will sell their vehicles for. So, I think what Dan is suggesting is: how dare Elon Musk not have a crystal ball and know what the future looks like so he can tell everybody exactly what Tesla will do before they do it? Yeah, and it's a great question. I think it's really about the price cuts in shine. And if you look at what's happened there, even BYD and some others have started to soften some of the price cuts. I think by continuing to cut prices, especially in China, that price war they're starting is actually making it worse. And I think that's been the biggest thing because you're talking about 40-50% overall demands coming out of China. We believe the long-term story is intact - the sum of the parts thesis, full self-driving AI, what they're going to invest in - but no doubt in the near term, and because of that conference call, you know, I think you're definitely going to see uncertainty. Well, I certainly agree that the long-term thesis is intact. Quite interesting, isn't it? A disastrous earnings call but the long-term thesis remains intact. Elon Musk didn't tell Wall Street what they wanted to hear, but the long-term thesis remains intact. It is almost as if what Wall Street wants to hear has nothing to do with Tesla's long-term thesis and whether or not it's intact. In fact, that's exactly the case. Way to miss the forest for the trees. Want more content, early access, bunch of perks? Click links in the pin comment.

I highly recommend checking out Athletic Greens 81. It's an excellent way to fill in nutritional gaps. It has 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals, and whole-food source nutrients, plus prebiotics, probiotics, digestive enzymes, and adaptogens to help you deal with stress. Also, if you click the link at the pin comment or head to drinka1.com/smmr, you can get yourself a 1-year free supply of vitamin D3 and K2. But don't take my word for it; here's what some users have to say: 'AG1 has changed my life. I was treating myself like a circus, eating like trash, rarely exercising, using alcohol as a stress crutch, and cannabis also. AG1 is what gave me the kick in the ass, got me back to the gym, motivated me to do more for myself, family, business, etc.'

There may be some skeptics, the same kind of people who think Elon Musk is a fraud, reading this and thinking, 'What do you mean there's no way that's possible, bro? It must be a placebo effect.' Believe it or not, this is a recurring theme. If you give your body everything it needs to feel and perform its best, including having a lot more energy, you'll need ways to use that energy. For me personally, that includes more exercise, moving my body more, more social activity, and more cognitively demanding tasks, including producing a ton of exclusive content on Twitter and on Patreon, plus my daily YouTube uploads. The proof is in the pudding. Here's another testimonial from a viewer of this channel, SMR: 'You asked me to provide feedback on AG1. Here it is: It has helped with mental acuity, stamina, and intestinal waste management. It certainly helps with regularity and digestion. That's what the digestive enzymes are for. It has also dramatically reduced my cravings for sugar. You guys need to stop eating sugar; it's poison. I'm 59 and overweight, aka 'fat'.'

I think that's a technical term for overweight. Isn't it fat or obese?  I can't remember. I average 100 hours a week in the West Texas oil fields as a safety supervisor. Jesus Christ dude, no wonder you're struggling to keep your weight under control. 100 hours a week, brutal. It has helped me lose weight, but it is not enough. Appetite suppressant can help fat people suppress cravings and motivation to be healthier is critical for changing your diet. Love you brother. Again, this is a great point. It's something people really don't seem to grasp. If you have more energy, everything becomes easier. It's like turning on easy mode for life. A few years ago before I was taking AG1, my health was trash. I was struggling to get through the day. Had afternoon fatigue. The last thing I wanted to do was either use my brain or move my body.  Didn't have the energy.  Now my biggest struggle every day is figuring out ways to use that energy. I'm exercising way more, doing a lot more with my friends and family, and of course, my work output has increased substantially. And you can fact check me, check out the average length of my videos I was posting on YouTube 3 years ago. Need I say more? And one final testimonial, love this one. Okay, here's the deal for me with this AG1. I'm 41 years old and not the type to eat, drink, smoke, or sleep healthy.

=====

So, I was skeptical. That being said, here's what I experienced: Day one- me. Day two- afternoon fatigue was about 45 minutes late. Day three- zero afternoon fatigue. Day four- zero afternoon fatigue plus extra energy. Day five- again, zero afternoon fatigue plus energy. Wondering what the f***. Really. See, this is the thing, right? The results for many people are just almost too good to be true. This. This is the same experience I had. My afternoon fatigue just vanished out of nowhere. I'm like, wait what? The why am I not tired in the afternoons anymore? Surely it's not that AG1, is it? Turns out, it was. Day six and seven- same thing. Day eight- same thing plus I had the want to get things done around the house that I normally would slack off and not get done. Again, the point, extra energy. You'll need to use it. You'll find ways to use it. Day nine, ten, and eleven, and today is day 12. I love it. So, however you manage to get me to buy it, I'm so glad you did. Thank you so much, SMR. It really changed me. So far, guys, this really works. Just try it. By the way, this is the reason I continue to relentlessly promote AG1. A lot of people get really mad in the comments- oh my God, SN's sold out. Oh my God, he's a scammer. This is fraud. But constantly, I'm pretty sure everyone making these comments is also currently short Tesla stock. I'm not particularly concerned about people having a negative perception. Those folks suffering from small brain syndrome, still living in my bum's basement syndrome, etc., writing mean comments claiming AG1's a scam or it doesn't work. I mean, bro when I get feedback like this, this is what keeps me going. And remember, there is a 90-day money back guarantee. There's nothing to lose here- just try this stuff for a month and if you don't get these results, get your money back. See? It's a literal no-brainer. It's an IQ test at this point in time. Testimonial after testimonial after testimonial like this. Get your money back if it doesn't work. Just try it for a month, and if it doesn't work, get your money back. Today's the day.
