Tesla stock collapses after Q3 earnings. We think investors are kind of missing the forest for the trees here. Then what does Tesla look like, take me 10 years down the road for this company? Are we talking about a completely different beast? If you look at my 305 price target, only 10% is cars, actually 70% of it is robo taxi, and 20% of it is just FSD itself. So, this is a completely different future for this company. Don't underestimate the robo taxi thesis, that is a very real thing, it's 100% happening. I think it's going to happen before you know it too. I mean, if you looked up disaster in the dictionary, there'd be a video of last night's conference call. We believe the long-term story is intact, the sum of the parts thesis - full self-driving AI, what they're going to invest in, but no doubt in the near term and because of that conference call, you know I think you're definitely going to see uncertainty. Today, a very mixed bag of reactions after Tesla's Q3 earnings call, and Tesla stock itself collapses. As usual, Tesla stock is down 9.3% during hours and down another 1% after hours for a total of more than 10%, which is par for the course with Tesla stock. In case you have a short memory or lack of perspective, I found this on X. We're looking at the biggest one day loss on Tesla stock from open to close throughout the company's history, biggest daily loss down 21.1% that was in 2020, followed by 19.3%. We've had a down day of 18.6%, 17.2%, 16%. You guys get the point right? Let's keep scrolling. Where can we find today's loss here? Still scrolling, we're in the 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%. Here we go. Today's loss during hours, number 31 on the list of biggest daily losses on Tesla stock. There have been 30 days in which Tesla stock was down more, many of those substantially more. As I've said in the past, Tesla stock remains more volatile than your ex-girlfriend, and for the record, I bought more today. Not that I was waiting to buy today, I just had more money today.
