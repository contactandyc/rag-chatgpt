Tesla Stock Collapses After Q3 Earnings

we think investors are kind of missing the forest for the trees here then what does Tesla look like take me 10 years down the road for this company are we talking about a a completely different Beast if you look at my 305 price Target only 10% of that is cars actually 70% of it is Robo taxi and 20% of it is just FSD itself so this is a completely different future for this company don't underestimate the robo taxi thesis that is a very real thing it's 100% happening I think it's going to happen before you know it too
I mean if you looked up disaster in the dictionary there'd be a video of last night's conference call we believe the long-term story is intact the sum of the parts thesis
full self-driving AI what they're going to invest in but no doubt in the near term and because of that conference call
you know
I think you're definitely going to see uncertainty today a very mixed bag of reactions after Tesla's Q3 earnings call and Tesla stock itself collapses as usual Tesla stock today down 9.3% during hours and down another 1% after hours for a total of more than 10% which is part of the course with Tesla stock in case you have a short memory or lack of perspective I found this on X we're looking at the biggest one day loss on Tesla stock from open to close throughout the company's history biggest daily loss down 21.1% that was in 2020 followed by 19.3% we've had a down day of 18.6% 17.2 16 you guys get the point right let's keep scrolling where can we find today's loss here still scrolling we're in the 12% 11% 10% 9% here we go today's loss during hours number 31 on the list of biggest daily losses on Tesla stock there have been 30 days in which Tesla stock was down more many of those substantially more as I've said in the past Tesla stock remains more volatile than your ex-girlfriend and for the record I bought more today not that I was waiting to buy today I just had more money today
