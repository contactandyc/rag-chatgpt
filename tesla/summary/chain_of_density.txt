Tesla's Q3 earnings caused a 10% drop in the company's stock, but the long-term outlook remains strong with a focus on robo taxi (70%) and FSD (20%).

The promise of Tesla's future is centered around its transformation into a different beast in the next 10 years.

Tesla is transitioning from selling cars to becoming a supplier to OEMs, which is more profitable. Toyota and Lexus will incorporate Tesla charging ports in their battery electric vehicles starting in 2025, and BMW has joined Tesla's Supercharger network in North America, showing the success of Tesla's transition.

=====

Despite increasing adoption of Tesla's charging standard, companies like VW and Tata remain holdouts. Tesla is shifting towards OEM supplier market to increase profits, and BMW recently joined Tesla's Supercharger Network in North America. Toyota is also adopting Tesla's charging standard for its customers.

=====

Tesla's position as a critical supplier of automotive technology is underscored by the adoption of its charging standard by most major brands in North America. In addition to charging, Tesla and OEMs are partnering on batteries, power electronics, and driving automation.

=====

Although separating Tesla's Auto Production Unit to have a Tech Manu may happen in the future, for now, the car as a proof of concept is still needed as Tesla is becoming a go-to place for OEMs to go for batteries, power electronics, charging, and Full Self-Driving (FSD). The value of a car company is much less than a tech company as 70% of Tesla's $305 price target is focused on Robo taxi and 20% on Full Self-Driving technology.

The article highlights the potential profitability of an Elon project, the reality of robo-taxis, and the author's belief that they will launch in 2024. It also discusses market and street expectations for Tesla, and the lack of details provided during a recent conference call.

=====

During the recent Tesla earnings call, Elon Musk spoke about his thoughts on macroeconomics rather than providing specifics on price cuts, gross margin outlook, and future demand that Wall Street analysts were hoping for. Some were disappointed, but it is important to keep in mind the significance of the arrival of Tesla's robo-taxis and understand that they will be highly profitable.

=====

During Tesla's recent earnings call, Elon talked about the macro economy instead of providing details of interest to Wall Street, which resulted in dissatisfaction and disappointment within Wall Street.

=====

The outlook for Tesla is still strong, but the Cybertruck and margin outlook cast a shadow. Tesla's honesty allowed for honest discussion despite the somber note. The company's goods are 90% financed and is facing a lot of pressure from investors.

=====

Elon Musk's lack of clear communication about Tesla's future pricing is causing frustration as he leaves the door open for more price cuts. The market is unpredictable, and it's impossible to predict its moves; therefore, Tesla is focused on the market-clearing price while adjusting prices to meet demand.
