Tesla Stock Collapses After Q3 Earnings

we think investors are kind of missing the forest for the trees here then what does Tesla look like take me 10 years down the road for this company are we talking about a a completely different Beast if you look at my 305 price Target only 10% of that is cars actually 70% of it is Robo taxi and 20% of it is just FSD itself so this is a completely different future for this company don't underestimate the robo taxi thesis that is a very real thing it's 100% happening I think it's going to happen before you know it too
I mean if you looked up disaster in the dictionary there'd be a video of last night's conference call we believe the long-term story is intact the sum of the parts thesis
full self-driving AI what they're going to invest in but no doubt in the near term and because of that conference call
you know
I think you're definitely going to see uncertainty today a very mixed bag of reactions after Tesla's Q3 earnings call and Tesla stock itself collapses as usual Tesla stock today down 9.3% during hours and down another 1% after hours for a total of more than 10% which is part of the course with Tesla stock in case you have a short memory or lack of perspective I found this on X we're looking at the biggest one day loss on Tesla stock from open to close throughout the company's history biggest daily loss down 21.1% that was in 2020 followed by 19.3% we've had a down day of 18.6% 17.2 16 you guys get the point right let's keep scrolling where can we find today's loss here still scrolling we're in the 12% 11% 10% 9% here we go today's loss during hours number 31 on the list of biggest daily losses on Tesla stock there have been 30 days in which Tesla stock was down more many of those substantially more as I've said in the past Tesla stock remains more volatile than your ex-girlfriend and for the record I bought more today not that I was waiting to buy today I just had more money today
and oh that's convenient isn't it a discount by the way thank you to everybody who noticed me having an auditory hallucination yesterday I did Mis hear what CFO said on Tesla's earnings call regarding volume cost and so on I was like what the going on well it turns out the reason I was so confused is cuz I heard something that wasn't actually said the most awkward part is I wasn't even high so to be clear what the Tesla CFO said yesterday was that one of Tesla's factories either Berlin or Austin had reached per unit cost of Fremont not volume and cost which makes a hell of a lot more sense hence why I was so confused it was a mess on numbers and a miss on sentiment I would say it was a trifecta of Doom from Tesla tell me the other side of the trade
yeah certainly I think people were expecting them I think to miss uh they had some production cuts for upgrades um
but I think what the what the investor base is really missing is this is actually a part of a giant pivot uh towards become a supplier uh to other OEM and eventually licensing FSD you know initially they said they were going to have all these volumes you know selling selling 20 million cars you know these sorts of things I think we're noticing the company changing the narrative towards maybe not making as many cars but now pivoting towards selling charging infrastructure Power Electronics batteries and then yes FSD and autonomy that's the real money maker anyway we think investors are kind of missing the forest for the trees here I have a lot to say on this first of all as most of you will know when I first published my Tesa valuation model in 2021 I already included Tesa license SD to other Automotive manufacturers in the future so this is a no-brainer it's now since been confirmed that Tesla will do this they've even disclosed that they've been in talks with a major automotive manufacturer about this very thing licensing FSD and one of the noted exceptions as in it might happen probably will happen
but it's not yet included in my valuation model also from day one was Tesla licensing batteries to other Automotive manufacturers but only after they can meet their own needs which is going to be a while regarding Tesla pivoting away from 20 million electric vehicles sold per year unlikely very strongly disagree with Tom on this that being said he is right investors absolutely are misting the forest for the trees at least short-term traded mindset investors who aren't really investors they're short-term Traders and gamblers while everyone is laser focused on short-term gross Automotive margins and volumes and this that and the other Tesla is on the cusp of solving autonomy and unlocking a de trillion opportunity
but you wouldn't know that based on Tesla stocks reaction today all the armchair Einstein's telling Elon Musk that he's not very good at running an earnings call
and therefore he shouldn't do it I noticed by the way 99% of the people providing their unsolicited feedback on why Tesla sucks and why Elon sucks and everything else 99% of these folks either manage money for other people curious and or just extremely emotionally volatile in the first place and possibly suffer from bipolar disorder not making light serious comment why is that all the long-term investors who seem to be emotionally stable are like bro buying opportunity isn't that interesting that I mean that's really interesting Tom because you know even here in the UK If I do a road trip with an electric car the supercharging stations are so much more efficient and then you have the other ones where you have these long long lines so it's clear that there is demand for that kind of thing
but then what does Tesla look like take me 10 years down the road for this company are we talking about a a completely different Beast what the did she just am I hallucinating again did someone in the fin media just asked somebody discussing Tesla to describe what the company looks like an entire decade from now what's going on I swear after my recent hallucination maybe I just imagined that as well this is amazing to see
but so strange 10 years into the future we're supposed to be worried about tomorrow or next quarter and panicking especially about gross Automotive margins I think so absolutely you know it's interesting
you you posited the Netflix example before how it's creating today if you remember Netflix in 200 to uh 2013 went through a very difficult transitioning shifting from DVD uh rentals towards streaming and it was a painful
but then it wound up being wildly successful I think something similar is a foot here with Tesla from selling cars to now becoming a supplier to oems which honestly is far more profitable we just saw BMW announc yesterday they're joining Tesla Supercharger Network in North America they said previously they'd never do this met like never and in fact I roasted BMW for being extremely late to the party and then pointed out that there's still some hold outs well guess what some breaking news finally the biggest Titanic of all Toyota adopts the North American charging standard to expand customer charging options welcome Toyota you morons Toyota and Lexus customers will have access to more than 12,000 Tesla supercharges in North America and Tesla and Lexus will incorporate the nacs ports as in Tesla charging ports inser p and Lexus battery electric vehicles starting in 202 5 it's embarrassing how long it's taken
but hey better late than never right I saw this on X shout out to Richard Smith ignore the headings here green background means these companies have adopted Tesla's charging standard red not yet notice we got for/ lcol by the way the bubbles here are Brands and sub Brands all owned by the same entity so Ford and sub Brands GM and
sub Brands Volvo Lotus postar Mercedes Jaguar Land Rover Nissan Mitsubishi Honda Aura Hyundai K rivan BMW Rolls-Royce mini Toyota Lexus Suzuki Subaru some of the holdouts you do have to ask yourself what the hell are VW doing what is tantis doing
I mean hello why a head scratcher Tesla's really starting to become the place where oems have to go to for all of these things batteries Power Electronics charging
and then we think ultimately FSD what would that do to valuation I'm looking back here on a 5-year chart $412 is where it is why not say to the market
actually I'm going to carve out this Auto production unit uh and I I'm going to have a Tech Manu I am a tech manufacturing supply chain company with that that hives off what is a car company and gives you a tech company does that re-engineer the value quicker to $35 would his ego let him do that that's the question that goes in the back of my mind
yeah
well you kind of need the cars as a proof of concept right to see FSD to see the technology
firsthand
so it's really a proof of concept today but if you look at my 305 price Target you know only 10% of that is cars actually um I have uh you know 70% of it is Robo taxi and 20% of it is just FSD itself so this is a completely different future for this company and for what it's worth my test of fair valuation especially in the later half of this decade the slice that Automotive makes up of that entire valuation is a spec relative to everything else in particular FSD the software component now that being said does anyone know the number to report a Wall Street analyst for breaking the rules because clearly Tom is putting things in his spreadsheet that he's not allowed to CU they don't yet exist and that's illegal on Wall Street so who do I call to uh get him fired or reprimanded any anyone know you need the car as the proof of concept as far as separating these businesses out maybe that happens in the future
but really what they need to do is show that take rate of FSD how profitable it could be and then in the future the robo taxi promise that's ultimately what he talked a lot about in the call last night
and I think that's really ultimately going to solve this whole jigsa puzzle but can I ask you the one thing that I was fascinated about is the robot I'm going to need one of these in later life
I I think this is the thing it's going to be able to do yoga apparently next year the robot what portion of Robotics on a slightly more serious valuation note will robotics play in this company I'm definitely hallucinating right they didn't just ask seriously about Tesla's humanoid robot and how that would contribute to Tesla's future valuation I need to replace my Waterfield with it
I'm obviously tripping ball somebody's put something in the water supply here that didn't just actually happen did it
I mean today
I I'm not giving any credit for it right now I think that's a call option to the Future um
I that's an Elon project currently but Elon projects in the past have wound up being wildly profitable so today I don't include it in my valuation but don't underestimate the robo taxi thesis that is a very real thing it's 100% happening I think it's going to happen before you know it too once again I find myself in agreement with Tom most of you will know by now when I first published my Tesla valuation model back in 2021 I had the first Tesla robot tax Affair taking place somewhere on Earth in 2024 as in late 2024 again if you got the original copy you can go fact check me see exactly how many robotx will be operating by the end of the year not many and while that estimate in terms of the timing has not changed my confidence in that estimate has massively increased especially after the recent n to n FSD demo now I personally think that late 2024 is sooner than most people think of course I could be wrong I probably will be wrong just how wrong will I be the bigger question is when do most people most analysts expect tesar Robo taxis will awaken because when they do look out I mean if you looked up disaster in the dictionary there'd be a video of last night's conference call
and I think the problem is is that the street wanted to get details have the price Cuts ended where is the gross margin Outlook what do the man ultimately look into 2024 and instead it was really must put on his macro economy sort of had
and that's not what the street wanted so Dan suggesting that Tesla's earnings call was a quote disaster why because biger bad Alon musk didn't give Wall Street what Wall Street wanted just like how Tesla didn't give consumers what consumers wanted which were internal combustion engine vehicles of course I do understand his point the Wall Street Point deers wanted some numbers to put in their spreadsheets Daddy to hold them and say everything's going to be all right
but instead Elon Musk is talking about the challenges R Pig cyber truck the extremely difficult economic situation insane interest rates concerns about rates being still high in the future or even higher probably unlikely but you never know in short milon musk was honest and transparent and clear and Wall Street wanted deception lies and a false smile may I suggest Wall Street you might find those things on a GM earings corit Tesla tells it like it is was lack of details and ultimately it was a somber note for especially when who looks at Cyber truck
and you look at the margin Outlook
and I think the long-term thesis is still there
but with no Rose car glasses I mean this was definitely what I'd call a disaster would you expect anything different from a guy who runs a company whose goods are 90% financed
right I mean that's that's the automobile
yeah
now look there's no doubt that that's something that's helped them and now hurts him but b car I think the big issue was really around the price Cuts because as you've seen the price Cuts there was a view that it would start to end by the by this point and
ultimately by having the door open and also by losing your seat CFO that was I think a huge part of The credibility investors came off that call us
and I can tell you institutionally speaking just a lot more questions no answers
and I think that's really the frustration and that's why you're seeing the stock under almost extra pressure because of that head scratcher conference call last night Dan you're one of the biggest Bulls on the street you come here all the time and have talked up Tesla for years correctly so in many ways by the way I'm glad you're here on a bad day too
but what did you get wrong here
I think what we got wrong in the short term was the price Cuts were going to end should we uh should we tell them about the master plan
oh wait hang on
no it's a secret master plan I forgot
yeah know let's not mention that no more price Cuts will ever happen tesa's plan is to maintain exactly the same price points on their vehicles and just advertise a lot to sell them at today's prices forever in there words you knew the poker move of the price Cuts this year has paid off massively and I think that's really show from a demand perspective but that did really 95% of price Cuts I believe are done I thought musk would would have put the Line in the Sand maybe a few more price Cuts then we're over instead by leaving the door open
I think the communication is maybe what we underestimate even for musk by not putting a line in the sand that's the frustration here because now it's a Pandora's Box and you can't put the genie back in the bottom
but well how can he put a line in the sand on price cuts when we see the 10year yield and the 30-year yield move up every single day to new highs and if that's really what's driving it how can you know that's a really good question you can't know to explain this rather simply Des is going to keep ramping production
and they're going to keep adjusting prices on their vehicles to continue to sell all of them and while doing so ensure that weight times aren't ridiculous it's that simple whatever is necessary whatever the market clearing price that is what Tesla will sell their vehicles for so I think what Dan is suggesting is how dare Elon Musk not have a crystal ball and know what the future looks like so he could tell everybody exactly what Tes will do before they do it
yeah
and it's a great question I think it's really about the price Cuts in shine
and if you look what's happened there even byd and some others have started to soften some of the price cuts and I think you by by continuing to cut prices especially in China that price War they're actually making worse
and I think that's been the biggest thing because you're talking about 40 50% overall demands coming out of China we believe the long-term story is intact the some of the parts thesis
full self-driving AI what they're going to invest in but no doubt in the near term and because of that conference call
you know
I think you're definitely going to see uncertainty
well I certainly agree that the long-term thesis is intact quite interesting isn't it disastrous earnings call but the long-term thesis remains intact Elon Musk didn't tell Wall Street what they wanted to hear but the long-term thesis remains intact it is almost as if what Wall Street wants to hear has nothing to do with Tesla's long-term thesis and whether or not it's intact in fact that's exactly the case way to miss the forest for the trees want more content Early Access bunch of perks click links in the pin comment athletic greens ag1 has given me a massive meaningful boost in energy allowing me to do a lot more every day including using my brain more and using my body
